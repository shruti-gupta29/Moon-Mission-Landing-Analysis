# Moon-Mission-Landing-Analysis

In my Moon Mission landing analysis project, I would start by extracting data related to the missions, such as landing dates, locations, mission objectives, and outcomes. Then, I would transform this data by cleaning it, removing inconsistencies or errors, and structuring it in a way that is suitable for analysis. Finally, i would load this prepared data into Power BI to create visualizations and perform various analyses to gain insights into the Moon missions.
Create a pie chart to show the distribution of different mission outcomes like successful landings, failed missions, and so on.
Use a stacked column chart to display the outcomes over time or by specific criteria, providing a visual comparison of the data.
Utilize Power BI's features to visualize the data based on the countries involved in Moon missions.
I create bar charts, tables, or other visualizations to showcase how different countries have contributed to Moon missions.
Implement filled maps in Power BI to display the number of launched missions from each country.
This visualization will help you see the geographical distribution of where missions were launched from and identify any patterns or trends.
By incorporating these visualizations into  Power BI project, i'll be able to present  Moon Mission landing analysis in a clear and engaging way.
